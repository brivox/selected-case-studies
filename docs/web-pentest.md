Case — Advanced Cybersecurity (Web Penetration Testing)

System Type
Production web application handling authenticated users and sensitive data.

Constraints

No access to source code initially

Limited testing window

Live production environment

No service disruption allowed

Scope

Authentication flows

Session management

API endpoints

Input handling

Access control

Methods Used

Manual web application penetration testing

OWASP Testing Guide methodology

Authenticated and unauthenticated testing

API endpoint enumeration

Business logic testing

Vulnerabilities Identified

Broken access control on specific API endpoints

IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)

Missing rate limiting on sensitive actions

Improper input validation on internal APIs

Impact Assessment

Potential unauthorized data access

Abuse of privileged operations

Increased risk of automated attacks

Remediation

Enforced server-side authorization checks

Implemented strict object ownership validation

Added rate limiting and request throttling

Hardened input validation and error handling

Post-Fix Validation

Retesting of all affected endpoints

Verification of access control enforcement

Confirmation of rate limit effectiveness

Outcome

No critical vulnerabilities remaining

Reduced attack surface

Improved overall security posture
